            not find any links for blondie songs that were embeddable, despite trying many smaller youtube posters and poor quality videos, boo. Resorted
            to just adding a list of links to songs on youtube-->

        <h2 style="color:rgb(9, 75, 199); text-align:left;"> About the Band</h2>
          
        <p style= "margin-left: 40px">Blondie is an American rock band founded by singer Debbie Harry and guitarist Chris Stein. The band were 
            pioneers in the early American new wave and punk scenes of the mid-late 1970s. Its first two albums contained strong elements of 
            these genres, and although successful in the United Kingdom and Australia, Blondie was regarded as an underground band in the United 
            States until the release of Parallel Lines in 1978. Over the next three years, the band achieved several hit singles including "Heart of Glass",
             "Call Me", "Rapture" and "The Tide Is High" and became noted for its eclectic mix of musical styles incorporating elements of disco, pop, reggae,
              and early rap music</p>
          
        <p style= "margin-left: 40px">Blondie disbanded after the release of its sixth studio album The Hunter in 1982. Debbie Harry continued to pursue a
             solo career with varied results after taking a few years off to care for partner Chris Stein, who was diagnosed with pemphigus, a rare autoimmune
              disease of the skin. The band re-formed in 1997, achieving renewed success and a number one single in the United Kingdom with "Maria" in 1999,
               exactly 20 years after their first UK No.1 single ("Heart of Glass")</p>
            
        <p style= "margin-left: 40px">The group toured and performed throughout the world during the following years, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll
             Hall of Fame in 2006. Blondie has sold 40 million records worldwide and is still active. The band's tenth studio album, Ghosts of Download,
              was released in 2014 and their eleventh studio album, Pollinator, was released on May 5, 2017.</p>
